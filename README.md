PSCondaEnvs
===========

Drop in replacement scripts that replicate Conda's activate/deactivate functions in Powershell.


###Installation:
Simply copy activate.ps1 and deactivate.ps1 into your Anaconda\Scripts directory.  You may need to remove or rename the existing BAT files but the PS1 versions seem to get precedence.


###Credit:
* Original Conda batch files.
